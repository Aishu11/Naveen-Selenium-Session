<!-- Under this test suite, we have 2 test blocks -->
<!-- Verbose is used to give the number of information for log -->
<!-- Parallel - is to run the test blocks in parallel mode and it should be equal to tests
thread-count is something to run in parallel -->
<!--If thread-count is set to 2, then we are total no.of blocks /2 - > Two browsers will be launched at a time -->
<!-- If we have 50 test blocks, then we shall use till thread-count as 5, More number of threads will result in more number of browser and it would result in performance withdraw-->
<!-- When we have 10 test blocks and we declare 20 thread count, then he performance will get affected
Thread- count is the concept of Test NG -->
<!-- Both thread-count and parallel words will work together -->
